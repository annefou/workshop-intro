## Program for the next 3 days

- Emphasis on version control
- Examples are on GitHub but OK to use another platform instead
- Challenge: different programming languages
- Quick look at the program: https://coderefinery.org/workshops/
- We don't aim to just teach you what is in the program. One other goal is to
  leave you with a personal computer set up to do science independently.
- All material is online and CC-BY-SA


## Interactive style

- Software Carpentry style of teaching
- Code-along
- Sticky notes system (red=request a helper come by, yellow=done with exercise)
