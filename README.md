# CodeRefinery: welcome and practical information for workshops

## Arrival

- Come on in, please try to sit next to someone, because we do lots of
  group work.
- **Any installation issues? Please talk to us.**
- Check [git configuration instructions (https://bit.ly/2wnTNV6)](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/01-setup/#configuring-git)
  link.

**Please test the following when arriving**:

- Test that you have Python installed: `python --version`
- Verify whether you can use both above commands in the same environment/terminal.


## Welcome

- Few words about the project: https://coderefinery.org sponsored by https://neic.no and partners

- Presentation of instructors and helpers
- Presentation of participants
- Distribute CodeRefinery stickers to attendees


## Program for the next 3 days

- Emphasis on version control
- Examples are on GitHub but OK to use another platform instead
- Challenge: different programming languages - when we need an explicit example,
  we will default to Python
- Quick look at the program: https://coderefinery.org/workshops/
- Example project: https://github.com/numpy/numpy - this is where we want to get:
  forking workflow, code review, automated testing, versioned documentation.
- We don't aim to just teach you what is in the program. One other goal is to
  leave you with a personal computer set up to do science independently.
- All material is online and CC-BY


## Interactive style

- Software Carpentry style of teaching: code-along and many exercises, minimize slides
- Sticky notes system (red=request a helper come by, yellow=done with exercise)
- Optional session feedback (one aspect you enjoyed, one aspect we need to improve)
- 6 months feedback


## Practical issues
